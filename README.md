I am passionate about free and open source software and am interested in working on projects that save users time and are easy to use, understand, and navigate. 

My background prior to getting into web developement includes over fifteen years of experience as a logistics officer in the military. I have a great appreciation for supporting large numbers of people and being able to scale effeciently and effectively.

Off the computer, I enjoy reading non-fiction and working on home improvement and automotive projects.
